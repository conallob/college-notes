        <LI>Our <A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/examples/chapter1/Rectangle.java">Rectangle 
        class</A> from Chapter 1 has instance variables of type int. However, 
        there is no good reason why the dimensions of a rectangle should be 
        whole numbers. Rewrite class Rectangle to have attributes of type 
        double. Now rewrite <A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/examples/chapter3/RectangleProgram.java">Program 
        3.7</A>, the program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle, 
        to use your new class. <BR><A

        <LI>Using your Rectangle class from Question 2 above, write a Java 
        application that creates three different rectangles with dimensions 
        specified by the user and then prints out the area of each. <BR><A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/tests/chapter3/solutions/threeThree.txt">Solution</A><BR><BR>
        <LI>Declare a Java class whose instances represent books. Such a class 
        might include instance variables giving the title of the book, its 
        authors, the publisher, and the date of publication, and provide methods 
        including those to obtain the title, authors, publisher and date of 
        publication from a book. Use your class in a program that creates a 
        number of books whose details are provided by the user and then prints 
        out the titles of each. <BR><A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/tests/chapter3/solutions/threeFour.html">Solution</A><BR><BR>
        <LI>Using the types int, double, and String, as well as any types that 
        you define yourself, give a declaration for class Person whose instances 
        represent people. Include at least ten attributes and any methods that 
        seem appropriate. Use your class in an application that creates two 
        instances of Person (representing a male and a female) and makes each 
        the spouse of the other. Your program should then invoke each object to 
        find out its spouse and, having done so, should print out the name of 
        the spouse. 
        <P><B>Suggestion:</B> you might want to consider defining additional 
        classes such as one whose instances represent the person's home or 
        business address.</P>
        <P><B>Hint:</B> the question should give you clues as to some of the 
        attributes and methods that you should provide.</P><A

        <LI>Write a Java application that will read the start time of some event 
        (in hours and minutes) and its duration (also in hours and minutes), and 
        then print out the time at which the event will finish. For example, an 
        event starting at 11:45hrs and lasting 2 hours, 37 minutes finishes at 
        14:22hrs. 
        <P><B>Hint:</B> think about what classes are required and make sure you 
        consider all the possibilities that might arise when adding a duration 
        to a time.</P><A

        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/examples/chapter3/SwapIntegers2.java">Program 
        3.14</A> swaps the value of two variables using a third variable to 
        temporarily remember the value of one of the variables to be swapped. 
        Write a fragment of code that swaps the values of two int variables 
        without using a third variable. <BR><A

        <LI>A complex number consists of a real part and an imaginary part where 
        the imaginary part is the coefficient of <IT>i</IT>. (iota - the square 
        root of -1). Write a class whose instances represent complex numbers, 
        and which provides methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide 
        complex numbers. Use your class in a program to that allows its users to 
        perform each of these operations on two complex numbers that they enter.

        <LI>Write a class whose instances represent points in two-dimensional 
        space and that provides methods to return the x and y co-ordinates of a 
        point and to move a point to a new position.<BR>

        <LI>Write a Java application that will read two distances, one expressed 
        in yards, feet, and inches and the other expressed in metres, and which 
        will report the sum of the distances as yards, feet, and inches and the 
        difference between the distances as metres.
