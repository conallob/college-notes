The SHIFTER Example
-------------------

This is a silly little program which is described in the User Guide.
Each process joins a group and then communicates with the members next
to it in the group order. To make the application type:

        % make <arch>

[Typing 'make' alone will provide the list of possible values for <arch>]

Once compiled, to run the application type:

        % mpirun run.chp <count> <arch>
        
where:
        count : number of processes
        arch  : architecture you built for above

For example:

        % make sun4
        % mpirun run.chp 10 sun4

will compile the C and FORTRAN executables  for sun4's and then run 10
processes, half C and half Fortran executables.
