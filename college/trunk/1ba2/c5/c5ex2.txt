Chapter 5 Exercise 2

I can go to a club if I have enough money and I'm dressed neatly and I'm not drunk:
goToClub = (money >= enough) && (amNeatlyDressed) && !drunk;

I should stop if I've found the house I'm looking for or I'm at the end of the road:
shouldStop = (position == housePosition) || (position == endOfRoad);

I should continue while I havent found the house and there are more houses:
shouldContinue = (!foundHouse) && (housesLeft > 0);
