\maketitle

Our neural network perception algorithm is the one supplied with the
assignment, seperated into functions to represent each stage of the
algorithm.


Due to a last minute issue concerning the format of the data supplied
with the assignment, we have no code to parse the data correctly and
thus no sample output or benchmarks of the code running on various
systems with differing values for $\theta$.
