CS/CSLL 1BA1	Homework 6	Due  19/11/02
---------------------------------------------

1  Let P = (1,2,1), Q = (2,1,2), R = (1,2,2).
Form the matrix U whose columns give P,Q,R.
Find the standard coordinates of a point
whose coordinates are (4,2,-3) in the
ordered basis P,Q,R, and find the
new coordinates (in the basis P,Q,R) of a
point whose standard coordinates are (1,8,3).

---------------------------------------------

2  With P,Q,R, as above, calculate the matrix
of the linear map which projects
points onto the plane OPQ in a direction
parallel to OR.

We have not studied oblique projections, but
you need only know what the map does to P,
Q, and R.

---------------------------------------------

3  With P=(1,2,1), Q=(2,1,2), and OR=OPxOQ,
(cross product), calculate the matrix for the
linear map which reflects points perpendicu-
larly in the plane OPQ.

We have not studied reflections, but
you need only know what the map does to P,
Q, and R.
