          In this essay, I aim to show that while much of the work

          carried out by MIT et al could have far reaching consequences

          for society, there still remains a bias on the technology

          as a means unto itself, without paying due heed to the

          ends that it should be aiming to cater to.

          For anyone vaguely familiar with the work of the MIT Media

          Lab[<a href="#mml">2</a>], the

          mention of the lab typically brings to mind an image of

          researchers, of all ages, playing with &quot;toys&quot;;

          wearable computers, synthetic musical instruments that

          respond without touch, and robotic devices.  What appears

          from the outside to be a playful world of whimsy attracts

          huge (and rarely negative) amounts of general media

          attention, with reporters dazzled at some new device that

          claims to remove yet another burden from our lives.

          As far as researchers in MIT are concerned, this work is

          destined to relieve the world of the burden of our everyday,

          <i>mundane</i> lives.  One such general project is the

          possibility of a completely networked, and <i>intelligent</i>

          house.  The computer in such a house will build up a

          profile of your daily habits, from what food you like for

          your breakfast, to whether or not you'll need a fresh

          milk delivery on a particular day.

          For instance, Michael Dertouzos, a Professor of Computer

          Science in MIT envisions the music system of the future,

          which will build up a profile of your tastes, and will

          utilise the high-bandwidth network connections that may

          be available then, to deliver music catering to your own,

          individual tastes.  He comments that

          Yet he never seems to sit down and ask why we would require

          such a technology.  The concept of having a system

          automatically choose music based upon our mood, or company

          seems useful; but it takes away one essential element -

          the human element.  We are perfectly capable of choosing

          our own music, yet MIT et al seem determined to see that

          we don't waste our time on simple tasks.  Many people

          still delight in the simple way that they can find a long

          lost treasure at the bottom of their music collection,

          while simply looking for a random piece of music.  One

          would wonder would the same sense of pleasure arise if

          we were to hit a <i>random</i> mode on our music system?

          Indeed, some researchers at MIT seem to be so jaundiced,

          pursuit of technology as the only goal.  A regular

          commenting on how much of the MIT Media Lab's work is

          not viewed in a social context; these fantastic inventions

          Where MIT's work could win is in the improvement of

          interfaces for users; much of the current under-utilisation

          of computers must stem from the fact that we have an

          un-ergonomic and clumsy system for accessing computer

          equipment.  For computers to truly strike home as a useful

          tool, they would need to become integrated into our lives;

          not just as a networked fridge as MIT might like to have

          us believe, but as a device that we can use comfortably

          at any moment in time, as easily as talking to a friend.

          know musical technique.  The very simplicity, and durability

          fundamental musical skills we would hope to give them.

          The opinion of MIT's detractors would seem to focus on

          the lack of balance in their research, between technical

          needs (which much of their work concentrates on), and the

          pure social and educational requirements which should be

          Much of this stems from the huge commercial backing that

          the MIT Media Lab receives (on a basic level, this is

          from the front page of the Media Lab website[<a

          href="#mml">2</a>]).  With many

          different industries vying to get a new product to sell,

          the focus of research may not necessarily be on people's

          needs, but purely on commercial matters, i.e. what will

          make a company money.  Thus we end up with a market created

          for a product, rather than the natural opposite.

          In conclusion, there are essentially two charges levelled

          at MIT; firstly the general proposition that so-called

          labour saving devices contribute to a banal and dry

          lifestyle, taking away from traditional values such as

          pride, and satisfaction in your work, such as the earlier

          example of cooking.  While I feel that that is true, the

          more serious charge is that MIT creates devices as an end

          unto themselves, not to meet the needs of our society.
