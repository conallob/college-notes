      <p>The abundance of early predictions and hopes for the Internet, adds interest 

	and complexity to task of comparing prediction and reality, with the focus 

	on technology, usage and social impact.<br>

      </p><br>





      <p><font size="5"><b>The Internet - Predictions and Reality</b></font></p>

      <p>As we move into the 21st Century, it is natural to reflect on what has 

	gone before. Enhanced by media hype, cut throat marketing and the short-term 

	memory of the general population, the Internet was a strong runner in 

	the invention of the century. A relatively new technology, early predictions 

	ranged from the learned to the ridiculous, and have continued right to 

	this day. Historians will tell you that to plan for the future, it is 

	essential to analyse the past and in this case, it requires differentiating 

	the sensationalist from the sensible while examining the three fundamental 

	aspects of the internet, technology, information and social impact.</p>





      <p>"The network of networks" indeed describes what is the technological 

	basis behind the much-touted "Information Revolution". What is easy to 

	forget, however, is the technology and the humble beginnings that has 

	allowed these changes and innovations to take place. The physical components 

	of the network have changed as much, if not more, than the abstract vision 

	that is the "web". Its goals and uses and also the technology that controls 

	it, have changed beyond recognition and left its instigators overwhelmed 

	at its development, leaving predictions of the day seeming conservative 

	and extremely modest. </p>





      <p>Without delving too deeply into the complex history of the Internet, 

	a brief overview displays its metamorphosis to the best effect. Ironically 

	what began its life in 1970, as the Americans defence forces contingency 

	plan in the event of nuclear attack has now become what is described as 

	"a rare example of a true, modern, functional anarchy"<b><tt>1</tt></b> 

	. In its most primitive form the Internet was four interconnected computers 

	existing primarily to execute long distance computing between military 

	bases. However within months of its creation, users had warped the computer 

	sharing network into a long-distance high-speed electronic post-office 

	[Sterling 93]. Although at first frowned on, the authorities soon realised 

	the potential of the new unexpected adaptation. Much to it's designers 

	astonishment within the space of 2 years what was meant to be a top secret 

	military network was now connected to over 30 nodes ranging from universities 

	to scientific institutions who were using it for personal and academic 

	purposes. The original network was officially retired some years later. 

	The connections however, continued to be used and became known as the 

	now infamous "Internet". </p>





      <p>The change in usage led to a need for change in the technology being 

	used. As more and more institutions connected, the demand for domestic 

	use also increased. At this point the transition between TCP/IP connections 

	(direct connections to the physical network) and connections based on 

	the telephony service came about. Soon the emphasis for development was 

	focused on the speed and convenience of personal access. Personal modems 

	have defied early predictions, as speeds have grown from 2400bps (bits 

	per second) to 56,700 in recent times. Here, however, we have reached 

	somewhat of an impasse, as the speed is limited by household analogue 

	phonelines with restricted bandwidth. The new buzzword "ISDN", however, 

	bodes a new era in connection as digital communications comes to the fore, 

	promising speeds of 128,600bps and higher. Although improving at an amazing 

	rate, reality falls a little short of the, perhaps optimistic, predictions 

	of W. R. Johnson Jr. in his book Technology 2001 hoping that "The 1990's 

	will certainly resolve any remaining technical gaps in physically connecting 

	devices and networks". Hopefully the realisation of his vision is nearing 

	with the enticing options of optics, satellite and many more innovations 

	as users demand faster and instant global access.</p>





      <p> Perhaps the most surprising aspect for the developers of the original 

	network is the increasing invisibility of the physical aspects of the 

	"Web". Shadowing the policy and goals of operating systems such as Windows 

	and the Macintosh system, users of the web are sheltered completely from 

	even the most basic knowledge of the Internet. Even computers have become 

	a "largely invisible part of the infrastructure" <tt><b>2</b></tt>. This 

	dumbing-down of the process minimises one of the most prolific aspects 

	of the Internet, the universality of the transfers. This was a common 

	goal for many of the early developers and an ethos laid out in Tim Berners-Lees, 

	who many consider "inventor of the internet", original proposal for funding 

	- "We should work toward a universally linked information system, in which 

	generality and portability are more important than fancy graphics techniques 

	and complex extra facilities"<tt><b>3</b></tt>. These goals are among 

	the many that have been attained and exceeded. </p>





      <p>The changes experienced and witnessed by the developers of the original 

	Internet must have left them dumbfounded. While creating the ARPANET, 

	scientists could not have predicted the metamorphosis of their creation 

	over a space of a mere 30 years. Both purposes and technology have mutated 

	beyond all previous form and what we are left with is an entity so changed 

	that no one could have predicted the reality that is now popular culture. 

	Technologically there is no doubt that the Internet has met and exceed 

	all expectations and predictions and "If the Internet stumbles, it will 

	not be because we lack for technology, vision or motivation." <tt><b>4</b></tt>.

      <p>"Some drink from the fountain of knowledge, others just gargle"<tt><b>5</b></tt>. 

	As an information service, the Internet was pitched as many different 

	things by many different people. The hopes voiced in relation to content 

	were varied and even at times contradictory. With many different factions 

	trying to mould the web into their vision, has what's emerged satisfied 

	anybody at all? </p>





      <p>In the early stages of the web many saw it as 'the champion of the people'. 

	A utility that would allow the ordinary person to fill the niches that 

	are so often left unfulfilled by mass media. Tetsuro Tomita saw this as 

	filling a "Media Gap" in offering immediate delivery of information to 

	specialised audiences; audiences that were previously left uncatered for. 

	There would no longer be the constraints of traditional publishing as 

	people finally found a medium in which to express their opinions and interests. 

	"Dissemination of ideas on a mass and medium scale is no longer filtered 

	through organisations and institutions but can come directly from individuals." 

	<tt><b>6</b></tt> The ideals were high but reality turned out to be less 

	inspiring. Statistics showing that 90% of internet usage is spent on the 

	top 10 commercial sites supports the fact that "The cacophony of voices 

	on the Net generates "noise", causing users to seek guidance according 

	to signposts - institutionally sponsored or established commercial publishers"

	<b><tt>7</tt></b>. 

	Although smaller WebPages created by individual enthusiasts can help the 

	isolated individual, for professional or academic use, the majority of 

	individual webspace is used for personal or entertainment purposes. The 

	high hopes of early speculators may have been dashed but the majority 

	of websites have a high entertainment value, which must also be recognised 

	- "There is much Pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge." <tt><b>8</b></tt> 

      </p>





      <p>One of the most popular analogies is the comparison between the Web and 

	a library. People view it as an essentially inexhaustible source of material 

	on all manners of subjects for all levels of understanding. Many of the 

	great publications are available in online format from daily newspapers 

	to encyclopaedias. "They daily build an immense distributed document, 

	one that is under eternal construction, in constant flux and of fleeting 

	permanence." <tt><b>9</b></tt> Without the inconvenience of outdated material, 

	publishers, both commercial and domestic, are able to provide, in theory, 

	consistently accurate and reliable information. Some enthusiasts of the 

	web also claim the diversity and adaptability of the material on the web 

	will not just change the way we live, but also the way we think. Kevin 

	Kelly [p76, Kling 96] writes that "Because of this impermanence, the type 

	of thought encouraged by the Net tends toward the non-dogmatic - the experimental 

	idea, the quip, the global perspective". </p>





      <p>The prediction that the Web would rival libraries, however, was an overstatement 

	of the quality, abundance and above all, impact that the Internet would 

	have on the collection and analysis of information. Rather than the highly 

	sorted collection of books defined by a library, the web should be viewed 

	more with the transience and fickleness of magazines. The huge diversity 

	in magazines is reflected strongly in the breadth and scope of Internet 

	content varying from well-established subjects to current trends and interests. 

	While books are generally restricted both with time delays and the need 

	for commercial longevity, magazines and websites can immediately pick 

	up on any of the sudden cultural turns entertainment takes, without the 

	same financial caution, filling a media gap, all be it a short-lived one. 

      </p>





      <p>The great diversity in the quality and accuracy of information displayed 

	in magazines is also seen in the Internet. Although the integrity of published 

	book, in the most part, tends to be uncompromised, this, unfortunately, 

	is not available on the web. Although there exists many trustworthy and 

	reliable sites, there also exists the "Tabloid" breed of sites where reports 

	and information are, at best poorly researched and unknowingly inaccurate 

	and at worst, purposely misleading. As consumers have learnt the difference 

	between sensationalist and truth-stretching magazines ("National Enquirer") 

	and established knowledgeable publications ("National Geographic") it 

	is also necessary for them to become "information smart"<tt><b>10</b></tt> 

	in respect to the web. </p>





      <p>Finally, just as magazines rarely change people's way of thinking, I 

	fear the Internet may also fail to live up to the high hopes of Kevin 

	Kelly. The basic browsing nature of the web is twinned with the "flicking" 

	of a magazine and this depth of reading rarely leaves lasting memory with 

	the reader. Quotes such "It was the best of times, it was the worst of 

	times."<b><tt>11</tt></b> would never have received the acclaim they did 

	if they had been featured in a magazine. Although like many new technologies, 

	the web holds the potential to change all manner of social fabric, whether 

	it will live up to the high hopes of Kelly and is supporters is yet to 

	be seen. It was once written of a question asked to Dante Gabriel Rossetti 

	as he painted the Arthurian legend at Oxford union - "And what were they 

	going to do with the grail when they found it?" [Leebaert 91]. We may 

	indeed have created a wondrous technology with infinite intellectual and 

	social possibilities but what remains to be seen is what we do with it.</p>





      <dl> 

	<dt> Surprisingly one of the most radical aspects of early predictions 

	  is probably one of the most accurate. As early as 1945, Vannevar Bush 

	  recognised that "Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely 

	  caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing"<b><tt>12</tt></b>. 

	  He realised that although our information was stored linearly, our mind 

	  works in a different manner. He saw that in order to be successful in 

	  information collection, we must copy the way human logic works - "with 

	  a mesh of associative trails"<b><tt>13</tt></b>. The mesh described 

	  by Bush is now one of the most basic premises of the Internet, "hyperlinks"; 

	  the ability to move through documents in an associative rather than 

	  linear way. Although successful in implementing the association of ideas, 

	  we are less successful in the organisation of the pages themselves. 

	  Search engines such as Yahoo and HotBot make attempts to sort into categories 

	  the melange of webpages with varying degrees of success. It is a far 

	  cry from the ordered basis Bush saw but as outlined in Technology 2001 

	  [Leebaert 91] "Once a given body of knowledge is seen as superbly organised, 

	  it becomes less relevant". So perhaps this "anarchy" and disorganisation 

	  is the very essence of the web.

	  <p>"There are subtle, complex changes taking place in human communication, 

	    thought and relationships"<b><tt>14</tt></b>. Experts predict that 

	    changes the internet is instigating in society are ever widening and 

	    irreversible. However, evidence seems to suggest that society is less 

	    easily influenced than some may like to think.</p>





	  <p> Many of the early developers of the Internet were confident that 

	    it would "illustrate how the inevitable pull of human beings towards 

	    each other in any communication system alters relationships and what 

	    they expect from comunication"<b><tt>14</tt></b> calling the resulting 

	    communities "electronic tribes"<b><tt>14</tt></b>. Critics however 

	    warned that the interaction between computer and human would lead 

	    to isolation, further erosion of society and that "psychological dependence 

	    on networked communication would create imbalances in offline relationships"

		<b><tt>14</tt></b>. 

	    The social impact argument is probably the most fiercely fought in 

	    the Internet debate, unfortunately, with no clear winner. Undeniable, 

	    communication has been transformed due to the development of the Internet, 

	    in professional, academic and personal aspects of life. Email is now 

	    a level competitor for telephony as a means of organisation and discussion. 

	    Chatrooms and ICQs have also revolutionised the way we work, socialise 

	    and even fall in love. While negative effects have yet to fully rear 

	    their head, isolation and an inability for many to function socially 

	    off-line are bound to be easily identified in the near future. However 

	    at present, it seems that online communication is the perfect complement 

	    to the busy lives we lead, without interfering with our person to 

	    person interactions. How long this will continue, however, we are 

	    unsure. As Hamlet's Ophelia said "We know what we are, But we know 

	    not what we may become"<b><tt>15</tt></b>. </p>





	  <p>One prediction that lacks fulfilment, is the expectation the Web 

	    will empower the public or "liberate us causing hierarchical structures 

	    to collapse and freedom to flourish"<b><tt>16</tt></b>. In short, 

	    many were hoping the anarchy that is the basis of the web would spread 

	    to reality. Knowledge may be power but it seems that the Internet 

	    is merely reinforcing well-engrained social strata. Research by Bruce 

	    Bimber, a political scientist, and many others, demonstrate that the 

	    internet isn't changing the balance of power but continuing it, allowing 

	    those with power to retain it. Critics such as Langdon Winner are 

	    frustrated at the marketing of the Web as an "Inherent democratizer"<b><tt>17</tt></b> 

	    spurring her to coin the phrase "Myth-Information". Despite predictions 

	    to the contrary, the internet is not, primarily, an instrument of 

	    social change and as a result anyone who hoped it would act as a catalyst 

	    for revolution is bound to be disappointed. </p>





	  <p>Although marketed as a global technology, evidence suggests otherwise. 

	    The obstacles preventing global dominance, are the pivotal problems 

	    of lack of investment and education. Although costs of personal computing 

	    are dropping at tremendous rates, this technology is still out of 

	    grasp for the majority of the world's population and with literacy 

	    rates below 60% in many countries, these are not problems that advertising 

	    and spin-doctors can solve. The Internet hasn't yet, and may never, 

	    have penetrating global benefit. It may, however, have an eroding 

	    affect on an all ready unstable system - "left to it's own devices, 

	    the Information Marketplace will increase the gap"<b><tt>18</tt></b>. 

	    Like many of the social aspects of the Internet, online equality is 

	    one that will remain unanswered for some years to come. </p>





	  <p>As it is considered the greatest invention of the 20th century, the 

	    volume of writings and predictions is unsurprising, as people strain 

	    to imagine the next generation of technology, information and society. 

	    With minor exceptions, the theme throughout has been one of meeting 

	    and exceeding expectations while taking an unexpected turn to keep 

	    experts on their toes. Disheartened speculators should take comfort 

	    in the final thought that "humans often utilise technology in far 

	    too complex and quirky ways for neat predictions to come true."<b><tt>19
