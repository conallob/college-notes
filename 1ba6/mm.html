      <H4>Introduction </H4>

      <P>In this essay I propose to examine the statement that "information 

      technology is the key to a brave new world". I shall do this by, firstly, 

      examining just what is meant by the notion of a "brave new world", and the 

      role that technology plays in this notional world; and, secondly, by 

      considering the possible alternate "new worlds" that may be reached 

      through different uses of technology. </P>

      <H4>The Brave New World </H4>

      <P><I>"O brave new world that has such people in't!"</I>[1] </P>

      <P>The term, "brave new world", is one that is often used in modern 

      discussions of technology and the social implications of technology. It 

      carries with it connotations of "ideal societies" and "technology gone 

      bad"; the brave new worlds most commonly envisioned are ones in which the 

      use of technology to produce a "better" society has caused some essence of 

      humanity to be lost. This derives from the use of the phrase as the title 

      of Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel <I>Brave New World</I>, which describes a 

      dystopian society of the future in which technology has been used to 

      reduce the individual to a component in the societal machinery. Many now 

      see the increasing penetration of technology in modern life as leading us 

      towards such a world, where we will, like Huxley's creations, be 

      conditioned and drugged into only being happy performing meaningless tasks 

      designed solely to support the socioindustrial framework within which we 

      are imprisoned. </P>

      <P>It is my suggestion that this is not necessarily the case. The society 

      that Huxley described is one whose primary features are not technological 

      at all; rather, it uses technology as enabling mechanism for social 

      structures which hearken back not to pre-technological times, but to 

      pre-human times - to the animal kingdom, and the insect societies. </P>

      <H4>The Hive Society </H4>

      <P>The society described by Huxley is a hive society, like that of an ant 

      farm or beehive. This is approximately true in a strictly physiological 

      sense, because the individuals of the society are conceived and born in 

      centralised "hatcheries", with large numbers of individuals (in the 

      thousands) born from single ovaries, and low-caste individuals hatched in 

      clone groups of tens or hundreds. This means that the level of genetic 

      diversity in the society is far less than one would expect given simply 

      the size of the population, and the assumption that individuals were born 

      from two-parent genetic crossover. However, the society is utterly 

      hive-based in a more esoteric sense: a single set of behaviours is 

      universal to the entire society; though this behaviour-set varies 

      considerably with the caste and function of each individual, this is more 

      akin to the differing expression of genetic traits within cells in the 

      body than to the existence of different genotypes. It is this single 

      society-wide behaviour set ? a single shared memotype, if you will ? that 

      is the defining feature of <I>Brave New World</I>'s society. </P>

      <P>(from the <I>Encyclopedia Galactia</I>, a meme is a 

      <I>"self-reproducing and contagious idea, thought structure, or other 

      information pattern which is propagated in ways similar to that of a 

      gene</I>[2]. A memotype is <I>"a class of similar memes"</I>[3]. These 

      terms are here used by analogy to gene and genotype.) </P>

      <P>This single memotype provides the society with a profound stability, 

      rooted in the fact that any potentially destabilising behaviour by an 

      individual - one incompletely or improperly conditioned, or in a situation 

      not allowed for by the society's conditioning - is unorthodox and outside 

      the proper behaviour-set, and will therefore be firstly resisted by the 

      individual (through the use of soma: <I>"the perfect drug... euphoric, 

      narcotic, pleasantly hallucinant"</I>[4]), and then by the society, in the 

      form of ostracism and eventual exile analogous to the manner in which 

      insect hives will kill mutated individuals to preserve their genetic 

      integrity. This stability is the reason for the existence of the society, 

      the World State, and is the cardinal virtue thereof. However, it is 

      achieved at the cost of a considerable problem: the World State cannot 

      advance. </P>

      <P>One may define the fitness of a society as its ability to survive the 

      various travails its environment imposes upon it. Clearly, some societies 

      may be more fit (in this sense) than others. One may envision a society of 

      a particular arrangement and fitness as occupying a place on a 

      three-dimensional landscape, with its arrangement placing it on the plane 

      and its fitness determining its height. A society may slowly increase its 

      fitness by incrementally altering the details of its memotype, a process 

      akin to climbing a slope. This is similar to the idea that an 

      asexually-reproducing bacterium may develop a resistance to drugs as those 

      who, through mutations from generation to generation, have such a 

      resistance are the only ones who survive to reproduce. However, such an 

      organism (or society) can eventually reach a fitness peak or <I>"local 

      maximum"</I>[5] in the fitness landscape - not the highest point in the 

      landscape, but sufficiently higher than those around it that mutation will 

      pull the organism/society back to the peak faster than it will push it 

      down the hill. For such an organism/society to evolve to higher fitness, 

      it would require a willingness to radically decrease its fitness over the 

      short term in order to reach the distant higher mountains of hyper-fitness 

      over the long term. The World State lacks this willingness. </P>

      <H4>The Cultivation of the Person </H4>

      <P><I>"...from the Son of Heaven down to the mass of the people, all must 

      consider the cultivation of the person the root of everything 

      besides."</I>[6] </P>

      <P>For a society whose memotype is universal, evolution towards greater 

      fitness can occur only through incremental improvements upon the existing 

      social structure. In order to display the <I>"perpetual novelty"</I>[7] 

      characteristic of evolution in the natural world, such a society would 

      have to undergo a shattering catastrophe - literally shattering, breaking 

      apart the social structure with the possibility that the fragments will 

      arrange themselves in a manner more suited to the changed environment. 

      Such shattering is the threat which technology poses to a centrally 

      organised, rigidly structured society: <I>"...truth's a menace, science is 

      a public danger. As dangerous as it's been beneficent. It has given us the 

      stablest equilibrium in history... But we can't allow science to undo its 

      own good work."</I>[8] Fred Cohen, the so-called <I>"father of the 

      computer virus"</I>[9], in his thesis said of possible dangers posed by 

      new technology: <I>"Rather than try to solve technical problems 

      technically, policy solutions are often chosen"</I>[10]. This is the flaw 

      of the brave new world, that a single set of policy solutions to every 

      problem has been implemented as dogma throughout the society, and no 

      potentially destabilising experimentation is allowed to disrupt this 

      policy; technical solutions are not merely unknown but shunned, for fear 

      that they may create more problematic (from the point of view of social 

      stability) possibilities than problem-solving ones. </P>

      <P>How then is a society to evolve? How may technology benefit society, if 

      it is such a threat to stability? </P>

      <P>The answer lies in the fact that technology threatens only the 

      stability of ossified, unchangeable societies. The society which makes the 

      best use of technology to increase its fitness is one which allows its 

      individual members to alter their behaviour as they desire, which does not 

      try to componentise the individual as an automaton whose only function is 

      to <I>"just do your little job... pull a lever, push a button"</I>[11]. 

      When the individuals are free to evolve their behaviour as they see fit, 

      based on the information freely available through IT, the entire society 

      can readily adapt to new circumstances without any need for catastrophe. A 

      society emergent from the evolving behaviour of IT-enabled individuals is 

      akin to a species utilising sexual reproduction to push its genome away 

      from local maxima and towards the lofty heights of perfection, and of all 

      the advances throughout human history, information technology represents 

      the most crucial to the fluid and efficient adaptation of society to the 

      brave new worlds in which we find ourselves daily. </P>
