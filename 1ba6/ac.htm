        <p><b>Introduction</b>:</p>

        <p>In this essay, I shall show how society has been influenced by IT and 

          how it will continue to shape our society using education as a prime 

          example. I will then analyse some possibilities on how education will 

          change in an attempt to integrate this new technology into the educational 

          sector. Secondly I shall analyse previous technological trends and theories 

          and attempt to apply these to IT to extrapolate the impact social change 

          will have in the Information Age.</p>

        <p><b>Education</b>:</p>

        <p> In the Age of Information, how exactly will social structure be influenced? 

          As communication becomes ever faster and cheaper with the advent of 

          electronic mail and the Internet, changes in society are inevitable. 

          Enormous amounts of information can be freely accessed, businesses and 

          stock markets can quickly exchange large sums of money electronically 

          and the workplace has expanded outside the domain of the office and 

          into devices such as laptops and mobile phones. No longer is distance 

          an objective, and change must take place in order to integrate this 

          new technology into key aspects of society.<br>

          One important sector that has remained relatively unchanged with the 

          rise of IT is the educational sector. In fact new technology such as 

          computers and the Internet, seem more of a burden in schools, then as 

          a revolutionary instrument to greatly aid education. Although there 

          has been an increase in the number of computers recently in schools, 

          the educational system lacks the proper time and resources to fully 

          integrate the computer and IT into the educational system. Teachers 

          must be trained in modern IT skills, and also with new strategies to 

          be able to integrate IT effectively into the curriculum. Technical support 

          must be also available. Funding computers for schools will not solve 

          the problem, if they cannot be fully integrated in the educational system. 

          In effect, the educational sector has failed in this respect. As IT 

          develops further, the old education system may need to be uprooted and 

          a new foundation based on dynamic-learning set.<br>

          William H. Dutton in his &quot;Information and Communication Technologies&quot; 

          makes an interesting point in relation to education in IT. He suggests 

          that in technology areas education will be not be terminated by a degree 

          or university qualification, but rather a lifelong learning will be 

          adapted, as qualifications will become outdated within a few years. 

          He assumes modular courses will become something of the past and a &quot;meltdown&quot; 

          in education will occur. [1] This statement would seem true with the 

          accelerating improvements in technology, and adds to the argument that 

          the educational sector needs to be seriously looked at.<br>

          A very interesting and topical book I came across by Frederick Bennett 

          called &quot;Computers as Tutors: Solving the crisis in education&quot;, 

          discusses in-depth the ideas of computers in education. Bennett boldly 

          suggests removing schools and even teachers from education and argues 

          the idea as computers and IT as the new educators. He makes strong arguments 

          for his ideas and some of the advantages he mentions such as individualised 

          learning and grade-less learning based reward system seem intriguing. 

          [2] With the use of Media on the Internet such as audio and visual, 

          it has become an even greater educational tool, as interaction is a 

          greater learning tool than reading from a book. </p>

          <b>Technological Trends and Theories</b>:</p>

        <p> It is impossible to predict the impact IT will have on society in 

          the future, but by analysing previous technological advancements and 

          their effect, we can make a somewhat educated assumption.<br>

          Arnult Gr&uuml;bler argues in his book &quot;Technology and Global Change&quot;, 

          that no individual technological creation can be so important as to 

          create a &quot;global change&quot; - it is the use society makes of 

          this technology that creates the change. [3] With reference to Kling's 

          &quot;Car-Computer Analogy&quot;, we can see that this is true. Urbanisation 

          and the increase of fossil fuels were not caused by the invention of 

          the automobile or the steam engine, but rather the application of these 

          inventions by social choice. [4] By applying this idea to IT, we can 

          gradually see a pattern, and the social changes emerging from society's 

          choice to embrace these new technologies. Already we can see changes 

          in the workplace, employment, education and health. Both the rail and 

          the car took around a hundred years to reach maturity and ultimately 

          technological saturation. As IT continues to grow and diffuse, will 

          it in turn shape society further with it? Previous trends in technological 

          advancement would assume that this is indeed so. <br>

          By comparing the car to IT maybe we can see some possible consequences 

          and problems that may arise as we head further into the Information 

          Age. Sean O'Connell's book &quot;The Car in British Society&quot; provides 

          a good background on this. O'Connell states that the design, marketing 

          and uses of cars were affected by social, cultural and economical factors 

          and in turn this impacted social aspects such as class and gender in 

          relation to the car. [5] At one stage, computers and the Internet were 

          only accessibly by those who could afford them, but as computers reduced 

          in price, like the car, they became more accessibly to the majority. 

          One striking idea O'Connell proposes is that as the levels of ownership 

          increase, so opinion is swayed against restrictions placed on the technological 

          invention. The consequences of death on the roads are accepted as natural 

          and inevitable to modern society. Society is blinded by the high rate 

          of death on the roads and assumes that increasing road safety measures 

          and issuing speed limits can reduce this rate. Robert Davis sums this 

          idea up nicely in his book &quot;Death on the streets&quot;:<br>

          &quot;<i>Idealogy sets hidden agendas of discussion, forms background assumptions 

          about the nature of those discussions and above all, makes certain features 

          of society appear natural or necessary&quot;</i> [6] <br>

          As consequences of IT, we can already take for example September 11th. 

          Will incidents like these become socially acceptable as by-products 

          of further IT development?<br>

          The idea of technological determinism seems somewhat one-sided, that 

          advancements in technologies will continue to shape society. Would it 

          not be truer to assume that society influences the growth and integration 

          of technology and in turn technology influences society? Wiebe Byker 

          and John Law in their book &quot;Shaping Technology/Building Society&quot; 

          put forward an interesting view, which I have taken keenly to. They 

          suggest an alternative view called the &quot;Interactive view&quot; 

          on how technology and society are inter-related. They suggest a &quot;matter 

          of fact&quot; distinction between the society and technology and argue 

          the &quot;interaction and exchange&quot; between the two, instead of 

          the assumptions of either social or technological determinism. [7] This 

          view seems more logical to me upon analysing technological trends, but 

          opens up the possibility that maybe we cannot accurately predict the 

          outcome of social change in relation to advancements in technology. 

          By looking at Klings &quot;Car-Computer Analogy&quot; again, we can 

          see the unpredicted consequences of the car - it was firstly issued 

          as a &quot;clean technology&quot;, but that is not the case today. [4]</p>

        <h3><br>

          <b>Conclusion</b>:</h3>

        <p> As I look at the ever-changing times, and then at the outdated educational 

          system, I can only but wonder what will happen to it. Will it be swept 

          away by the IT revolution and in its place, computerised teachers and 

          schools or will it remain as it always has for so long, caught in the 

          old methodology of teacher to class learning? Can we afford to keep 

          this system going? Unless education is reconsidered, the future for 

          education looks bleak. As lifetime learning becomes a reality and information 

          becomes more easily and freely accessible, will the whole notion of 

          education be done away with? Like the car, IT seems to be a wonderful, 

          advantageous, beneficial technology, but will IT harbour unforeseen 

          consequences as the car has? As access to technology becomes free to 

          all, will incidents like September 11th become the norm and socially 

          acceptable as consequences of our new technologies? The future ahead 

          seems both exciting and scary, and I agree that IT is the key that will 

          open the door, into a brave and interesting new world.</p>
