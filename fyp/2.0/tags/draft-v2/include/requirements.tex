\subsubsection{User Interface}

There is no need to provide a complete GUI interface to a user. Most
Unix users are capable of, or restricted to, command line interfaces via
an interactive shell. Therefore, the client should comply with the 
Unix de facto CLI standard, input is received via \verb!stdin!, output
is sent to \verb!stdout! and errors are sent to \verb!stderr!. By
following these de facto standards, it gives a user much more power, by
availing of the 
I/O redirection\footnote{generally referred to as the pipe, represented by the symbol $\mid$}

\subsubsection{Networking}

Building upon the existing software model, internet sockets should be 
primary IPC used to communicate between nodes. In order to be modern,
IPv6 sockets should be supported in addition to IPv4 sockets.

\subsubsection{Portability}

In an effort to resolve one of the key issues experienced in 2002, 
portability to allow compilation and execution on a wide range of Unix
and Unix like platforms.

\subsubsection{Cryptography}

Due to the potential for sensitive messages being sent between nodes
across a network, some form of cryptography is required to ensure 
security of the message contents.

\subsubsection{Unicode}

Support Unicode (UTF-8) input, allowing a user to input text using 
Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Cyrillic
and many more\footnote{The full list of supported alphabets and character sets is available at http://www.unicode.org/charts/}
alphabets and glyphs. 

\subsubsection{IP Multicast}

Multicast\footnote{A broad overview to multicast is explained later in Section \ref{app:multicast} on Appendix \ref{app:bg}}, 
a previously seldom used networking feature exists between Unicast and 
broadcast. For years, there were few uses for multicast connectivity, 
however there is now a growing number of uses, making it much more 
popular.
