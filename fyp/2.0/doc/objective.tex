Since John Tobin never finished implementing his \emph{oi} messaging
system, I decided to review the state of his work and explore ways to
build upon his work, in addition to adding additional functionality.


As of May 2002, the \emph{oi} client and server were functional, but
were primarily running on Solaris Unix. There were unresolved
compilation issues preventing it being ported to Linux. As a result, it
was unable to demonstrate messages in a distributed enviroment.


Therefore, it is my intention to complete John's \emph{oi} and add one
of two previously unprovisioned features, to increase functionality
given modern technical advances since 2002.
