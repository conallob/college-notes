I wish to thank my project supervisor, Stephen Barrett who not only
agreed to supervise my idea, but whose wisdom helped me though the
project.


I would like to thank (in no particular order) David Malone, Niall 
Richard Murphy, Ian Dowse, Gary Coady, Ian O'Connell, Aidan Kehoe and 
Conor McDermottroe, all of who helped spot logical and algorthimic 
mistakes, as well as always being willing to answer C related questions.


I want to thank Edsko de Vries for help with \LaTeX and XP-Pic queries
during the preparation of this report.

And finally, I would like to thank my father, who many years ago, asked
his 5 year old son to assist him to help reconfigure the hardware 
components of his computer. He didn't realise at the time what he had 
started...
