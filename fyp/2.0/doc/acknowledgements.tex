agreed to supervise my idea, but whose wisdom helped me though the
project.


I would like to thank David Malone, Niall Richard Murphy, Ian Dowse,

And finally, I would like to thank my father, who many years ago, asked
his 5 year old son to assist him to help reconfigure the hardware 
components of his computer. He didn't realise at the time what he had 
started...
