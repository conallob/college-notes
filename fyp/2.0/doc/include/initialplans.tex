The initial list of milestones was drawn up with a plan to create the
core functionality of the client first. Once the client accepted input,
transmit this input across a network.


When messages were passing across a network properly, additional
functionality such as UTF-8 encoding and encryption would be applied.
Then remote user delivery features would be added to form the daemon.


The UTF-8 formatting, encrypting client would then be integrated with a
complementing daemon, before finally adding IP multicast functionality
to the daemon.


The deadline for final completion of all these milestones was set as
early January, before eight weeks of quality assurance testing in an
attempt to iron out as many issues as possible before demonstration of
the system.

\begin{center}

\begin{enumerate}


\item Local Echo 

	\subitem Client buffers and echoes input.

\item Local Server Echo 

	\subitem Client sends text to Daemon, Daemon echoes text back.

\item UTF8 Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 2, with Unicode encoding involved.

\item Encrypted UTF8 Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 3, with GPG encryption in the mix.

\item Remote Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 2, but using network sockets.

\item Remote UTF8 Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 3, over network sockets.

\item Remote GPG UTF8 Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 4, with network sockets.

\item Local User to User 

	\subitem Client sends message to local Daemon, which sends to a 
	different user.

\item Remove GPG UTF8 User to User 

	\subitem Hybrid of 7 and 8.

\item Multicasting Remote User to User 

	\subitem Same as 9, using optional multicast sockets.
