Since John Tobin never finished implementing his \emph{oi} messaging
system, I decided to review the state of his project and explore ways to
build upon his work, implementing additional functionality.


As of May 2002, the \emph{oi} client and server were functional but
were primarily running on Solaris Unix. There were unresolved
compilation issues preventing from it being ported to Linux. As a 
result, it was not working in a distributed environment.


Therefore, it is my intention to complete John's \emph{oi} and add one
or two previously unprovided features to increase functionality
given technical advances since 2002.
