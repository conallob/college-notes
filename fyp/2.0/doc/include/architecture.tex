The architectural model of the system is relatively straightforward,
consisting of a client and a server. However, there are multiple
operational modes for each component.

\subsection{Operating Modes of the Client}

There are two operational modes for the client: direct and relayed.

Direct mode is a pure distributed system, using the peer to peer model.
When transmitting a message, a client connects directly to the
recipient node, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:client}.


Unfortunately, due to modern security concerns, it is often common 
practice to restrict access to non-local subnets by employing firewall
and/or routing table restrictions. Remote access is possible through
certain nodes, acting as proxies for allowed services. 


\subsection{Operating Modes of the Server}

The server can also operate in two modes: direct and proxy. When
operating in direct mode, the server accepts connections from the 
client, processes the message and attempts to deliver the message to a 
local user.


Alternatively, in proxy mode, the server simply accepts a message from a
client connection, buffers the message and relays it to the target 
destination, similar to the model currently used by SMTP, as depicted in
Figure \ref{fig:relay}.
