\subsection{Introduction}

Multicast is a data delivery method allowing data to be transmitted from
one-to-many and many-to-many delivery. The network itself is responsible
for generating the duplicate traffic, thus using bandwidth more
efficinently than using multiple Unicast connections between the source
and multiple destinations.

\subsection{How Multicast Works}

Multicast connections are based upon groups and group membership. In
practical terms, a multicast group is an IP number from the multicast IP
block, from the class D IP range 224.0.0.0/4.





\subsection{Interdomain Multicast Routing}

Additionally, in a similar manner to why IGP and EGP dynamic routing
protocols are required to populate routing tables, multicast routing
protocols are required to populate multicast group membership tables 
across routers on a network. Protocols such as MBGP and M-ISIS
