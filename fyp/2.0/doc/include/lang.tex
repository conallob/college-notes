Given the project requirements to build this system for the Unix
environment, there were many programming languages available to choose
from.


The initial decision was whether to use a compiled language such as C or
C++, or an interpreted language such as Perl, Python or
Java\footnote{Most people catogorise Java as a compiler language,
however due to the requirement of a VM to execute applications, it is
catagorised in this report as an interpreted language}. 


The traditional silver bullet in this choice is usually speed versus 
flexibility. Precompiled applications run faster and more efficiently. 
However, interpreted languages such as Perl and Python are traditionally
used for text processing tasks. 


Therefore, out of the 3 main options, for their common usage and
availablilty on a Unix system were C, Perl and Python. Ultimately, the
decision to use the C language was based on two reasons, the
availablilty of libraries and the tradition to write most Unix tools,
whether kernel-land or user-land, in C.
