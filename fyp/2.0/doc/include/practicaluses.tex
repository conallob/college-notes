Since there are many existing messaging clients and protocols available,
what use is there for this client? Most IM clients available are 
GUI-based. While there are a select few CLI based clients for Unix 
systems, they are all interactive clients that work in the 
foreground of a Unix console. These clients do not act as true Unix 
tools which are traditionally simple, concise and flexible, thus 
allowing a user to harness their immense power by combining multiple 
tools together.


Existing IM clients transmit unencrypted messages between users as
standard. Although there are 
recent enhancements\footnote{For example, Off The Record - http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/}
to encrypt messages, unencrypted messages are still transmitted by 
default. Additionally, these enhancements to existing IM protocols use 
different cryptography cypers since there is no standard, de facto or 
otherwise.


IP Multicast networking has only become popular in recent times, so most
networks still don't support IP Multicast partially, or at all. One of
the reasons why Multicast is not widely deployed is because there is yet
to be a "\emph{killer application}". Most multicast protocols 
distribute multimedia formats to many users. Hence, these complex 
applications are not suited to perform basic multicast functionality 
tests. A simple lightweight messaging system such as \emph{oi}, is a 
more suitable application to evaluate a multicast deployment before 
attempting more significant or complete tests.
