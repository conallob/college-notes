This report has been typeset using the \LaTeX{} markup language, 
and compiled using the \LaTeXe{} interpreter. 


All diagrams are original works by the author, and were generated 
using the \Xy-pic{} graphics pagkage for \LaTeX{}.



Throughout this report, I have assumed a familiarity with the
technologies and concerning areas. Acronyms are not explained upon first
use. Instead, I have provided a glossary of terms in Appendix
\ref{app:glossary}, where acronyms and other appropriate terms are
explained. In addition, I have created brief overviews for each 
of the relavent technologies in Appendix \ref{app:bg}.

I hereby declare that this thesis is entirely my own work and that it
has not been submitted as an exercise for a degree at any other
university.
