Since the project was running behind schedule, after consultation with
the project supervisor, it was decided that the number of milestones and
thus specificed features outstanding required a number of man hours that
would exceed the deadline.


Since the deadline was not flexible, therefore the outstanding
features had to be reviewed and reprioritised. Thhe aim of
recatagorising at least one feature as optional would result in a
reduction of required man hours needed, in order to meet the project
deadlines.

\begin{table}[Hbt]

\begin{center}

\begin{enumerate}


\item Local Echo 

	\subitem Client which echoes text back

\item Local Server Echo 

	\subitem Client sends text to Server, server echoes text back

\item UTF8 Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 2, with Unicode translation involved

\item Encrypted UTF8 Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 3, with GPG encryption in the mix

\item Remote Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 2, but using network sockets

\item Remote UTF8 Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 3, over network sockets

\item Remote GPG UTF8 Server Echo 

	\subitem Same as 4, with network sockets

\item Local User to User 

	\subitem Client sends message to local server, which sends to a 
	different user

\item Remove GPG UTF8 User to User 

	\subitem Hybrid of 7 and 8.

\item Multicasting Remote User to User 

	\subitem Same as 9, using optional multicast sockets

\end{enumerate}

The initial reprioritisation was primarily a regrouping of the
milestones. Instead of treating local and remote behaviour differently,
local connections were performed by using Unix Sockets IPC on a host's
loopback interface, therefore using the same mechanism for remote
connections.

\begin{table}[Hbt]

\begin{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Client Local Echo 

	\subitem Client accepts Input from stdin, buffers and echos

\item Local Daemon Echo 

	\subitem Client sends input to Daemon using sockets, Dameon 
	echoes transmission

\item UTF-8 Client Local Echo 

	\subitem Client accepts UTF-8 Input from stdin, performs checks and
	outputs UTF-8 to stdout

\item UTF-8 Daemon Echo

	\subitem Introduce Unicode formatting before and after transmission 

\item Encrypted UTF8 Daemon Echo 

	\subitem Introduce GnuPG encryption and decryption before and after 
	transmission 

\item IP Multicast Daemon Test

	\subitem Integrate join and unsubscribe functionality to IP Multicast
	groups

\end{enumerate}

\end{center}

\caption{List of Milestones Reprioritised}

\end{table}


Due to delays during testing and the remote Deamon echo objective, the 
outstanding milestones were further scrutinised and specified features
were marked as optional and removed from the critical path.
