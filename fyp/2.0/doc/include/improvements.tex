There are many future enhancements that could be made, if development of
this project were to be continued.

Some examples include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Cleaner, more efficient and secure C code

\item A more graceful daemonisation system, with multiple threads to
sustain concurrent queuing and delivery.

\item Structure for daemon to queue and process multiple messages as
efficiently as possible. 

\item Libreadline support for client.

\item Client and Server configuration files.

	\item Additionally, compatibility with configurations files from John
	Tobin's Oi and the various incarnations of \emph{hey} and 
	\emph{c-hey}

\item Modular message delivery system. Alternatives to \emph{write} 
include:

	\subitem The DBUS Messaging Interface on Linux and BSD Systems

	\subitem Growl Notification System on MacOS X

\item Signal handling facilities, for commonly used signals such as:
	
	\subitem SIGHUP 
	
	\subitem SIGSTOP

	\subitem SIGTERM

	\subitem SIGKILL 

	\subitem SIGINFO (on BSD systems).

\item Ability for alternative delivery mechanisms, such as queuing in
SMTP

\end{itemize}
