There are many future enhancements that could be made, FI development of
this project were to be continued.

Some examples include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Cleaner C coding, with a more graceful daemonisation system

\item Client and Server configuration files.

	\item Additionally, compatability with configurations files from John
	Tobin's Oi and the various incarnations of \emph{hey} and 
	\emph{c-hey}

\item Modular message delivery system. Alternatives to \emph{write} 
include:

	\subitem The DBUS Messaging Interface on Linux and BSD Systems

	\subitem Growl Notification System on MacOS X

\item Signal handelling facilities, for commonly used signals such as:
	
	\subitem SIGHUP 
	
	\subitem SIGSTOP

	\subitem SIGTERM

	\subitem SIGKILL 

	\subitem SIGINFO (on BSD systems).

\item Ability for alternative delivery mechanisms, such as queueing in
SMTP

\end{itemize}
