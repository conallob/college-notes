I wish to thank my project supervisor, Stephen Barrett who not only
agreed to supervise my idea, but whose wisdom helped me though the
project.


I would like to thank (in no particular order) David Malone, 
Ian Dowse, Gary Coady, Ian O'Connell, Aidan Kehoe and 
Conor McDermottroe, all of who helped spot logical and algorthimic 
mistakes, as well as always being willing to answer C related 
questions.


I also want to thank Adrian Colley, Paul McGaley, Cian Synnott, Colm
MacC\'{a}rthaigh and Colin Whittaker for providing feedback and ideas 
during the planning stage.


I want to thank Niall Richard Murphy, who not only was willing to answer
C related queries, but was generous enough to provide access to a remote
system as a replacement build enviroment.


I want to especially thank Edsko de Vries for help with \LaTeX \space 
and \Xy-pic queries during the preparation of this report.


I want to thank John Tobin for providing support and advise, in 
addition creating the core system model and codebase.

And finally, I would like to thank my father, who once upon a time, 
asked his 5 year old son to assist him to help reconfigure jumpers on
a motherboard. He didn't realise, at the time, what he had started...
