I would like to thank (in no particular order) David Malone, 
Ian Dowse, Gary Coady, Ian O'Connell, Aidan Kehoe and 
Conor McDermottroe, all of who helped spot logical and algorthimic 
mistakes, as well as always being willing to answer C related 
questions.


I also want to thank Adrian Colley, Paul McGaley, Cian Synnott, Colm
MacC\'{a}rthaigh and Colin Whittaker for providing feedback and ideas 
during the planning stage.


I want to thank Niall Richard Murphy, who not only was willing to answer
C related queries, but was generous enough to provide access to a remote
system as a replacement build enviroment after unforseen difficulties.

And finally, I would like to thank my father, who once upon a time, 
asked his 5 year old son to assist him to help reconfigure jumpers on
a motherboard. He didn't realise at the time, what he had started...
