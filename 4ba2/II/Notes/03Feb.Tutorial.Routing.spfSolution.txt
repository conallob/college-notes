Have a path, finished.. right?
No, we have a path but not necessarily the shortest path. 
 Djikstra algorithm runs until all nodes whose current path length is <
 shorter current solution.

Only when all paths are greater can you say that you have the SHORTEST
path.

So.... expand D

E      15     B

RT @ A 
F	3*	A
G	5*	A
B	2*	A
D	13*	B
C	6*	B
E	15	B

Two paths are the same for our current metric of cost.

The End...
