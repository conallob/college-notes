        <LI>List five classes of object that might be found in each of the 
        following programs: 
        <UL>
          <LI>a supermarket stock control program; 
          <LI>an air traffic control program; 
          <LI>a hospital management program. </LI></UL><A

        <BR><BR>
        <LI>List (some of) the attributes of instances of each of the classes 
        that you identified in question 1. In each case describe what the type 
        of the attribute is (i.e., what kind of values does it store?) <BR><A

        <LI>List (some of) the methods that might be provided by each of the 
        classes that you identified in question 1. <BR><A

        <LI>Modify <A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/examples/chapter1/RectangleProgram.java">Program 
        1.2</A> so that it prints out a message describing the purpose of the 
        program on the screen before printing out the area and perimeter of the 
        rectangle. <BR><A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/tests/chapter1/solutions/oneFour.txt">Solution</A><BR><BR>
        <LI>Modify <A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/examples/chapter1/RectangleProgram.java">Program 
        1.2</A> so that it creates two different rectangles with different 
        dimensions and prints out the areas and perimeter of each rectangle in 
        turn. <BR><A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/tests/chapter1/solutions/oneFive.txt">Solution</A><BR><BR>
        <LI>Modify your application from question 5, so that is first prints the 
        areas of both rectangles and then prints the perimeters of the two 
        rectangles. <BR><A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/tests/chapter1/solutions/oneSix.txt">Solution</A><BR><BR>
        <LI>Write an application that creates ten different rectangles and 
        prints out the area and perimeter of each. Your application should not 
        use any more local variables than <A

        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/tests/chapter1/solutions/oneSeven.txt">Solution</A><BR><BR>
        <LI>Write a class whose instances represent squares and which provides 
        methods to calculate the area and perimeter of a square. Use your class 
        in an application that prints out the area and perimeter of some square. 
        <BR><A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/tests/chapter1/solutions/oneEight.html">Solution</A><BR><BR>
        <LI>Write a Java application that creates a rectangle and a square and 
        then prints out the area of each. <BR><A 
        href="http://www.cs.tcd.ie/~vjcahill/1ba2/tests/chapter1/solutions/oneNine.txt">Solution</A><BR><BR>
        <LI>Write a class whose instances represent cubes and which provides 
        methods to calculate the area of one side of the cube, to return the 
        volume of the cube, and any other methods that you think appropriate.

        <LI>Write a Java application that first creates two different cubes and 
        then prints out the areas of their sides and their volumes. <BR><A

        <LI>Write a class whose instances represent cuboids and that provides 
        methods to calculate the total perimeter of the cuboid, to calculate the 
        volume of the cuboid, to calculate the areas of each of the sides of the 
        cuboid and any other methods that you think appropriate. Use your class 
        in an application that creates at least three objects representing 
        different cuboids and prints out the perimeter and volume of each cuboid 
        as well as the areas of each of their sides. <BR><A
