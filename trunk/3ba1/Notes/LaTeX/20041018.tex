\[ or  & = & \cup \]

\[ and & = & \cap \]

Mutually exclusive events supposed to disjoint sets of sample space. \\

\\

\[ P(A \cup B) 	& = & P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

\[ P(A or B)	& = & P(A) + P(B) - P(A or B)	\]

\\

\[ P(A \cup B) & \leq & P(A) + P(B) \cdots P(A \cap B) \geq 0 \]

\[ P(A \cap B) & \leq & min(P(A), P(B)) \]

Once consequence that is useful: \\

\\

\[ P(A') & = & 1 - P(A) \]

\[ A' \cup A = 1 - \mbox{certain event} \]

\[ P(A \cup A') & = & 1 \]

\[ A \cap A' 	& = & 0 \]

\[ P(A')	& = & 1 - P(A) \]


$10000$ students, $6000$ male. \\
$400$ Computewr Science. $240$ male. \\

\\

\[ P(male) & = & 0.6 \]

\[ P(In CS) & = & 0.04 \]

\[ P(Female) & = & 0.4 \]

\[ P(Female or in CS) & = & \frac{4000 + 250}{1000} = 0.425 \]

\[ P(Female and in CS) & = & \frac{150}{10000} = 0.15 \]

\\

$P(A and B)$ describes the relationship between the events. Does the occurance of $A$ increae, lower or leave $P(B)$ the same?

\section{Conditional Probability}

$P(A|B) - P(A)$ given that $B$ has occurred. \\

\\

\[ P(A|B) & = & \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

\[ \therefore P(A \cap B) & = & P(A| B) \times P(B) \]

\[ P(CS|Female) = \frac{P(CS \cap Female}{P(Female)} \]

\[ 	  	& = & \frac{0.015}{4000} /] 

\[ P(Females|CS) & = & \frac{CS \cap Females}{P(CS)} \]

\[		 & = & 0.375	\]

Being female discourages CS and vice versa.


\section*{Independance}

$A, B$ independant $\Longleftrightarrow$

\[ P(A|B) & = & P(A) \]

\[ P(B|A) & = & P(B) \]

or

\[ P(A \cap B) & = & P(A) \times P(B) \]
