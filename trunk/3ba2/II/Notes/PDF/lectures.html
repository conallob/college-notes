These transparencies are in <A HREf="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</A>
PDF format and can be read using the free  <A
HREf="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">acrobat
reader</A> 
or with recent versions of <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">Ghostscript</A>. You can also access
the lectures through a <a HREF="lectures.pdf">pdf 
interface</A>. Clicking on the chapter numbers in this file or on it
up-arrows in the slides gives a pdf overview of individual
chapters.  You can also get the <A HREF="../lects.tar.gz">latest
distribution</A> of all of the slides as a <A
HREF="http://www.gzip.org/">gzip</A>ped tar file.

<P>
We have divided the slides roughly into lectures. The division is largely on
logical separation, rather than what can be carried out in one say 50 or 90
minute slot. We have found that one lecture here takes
between 30 and 100 minutes to explain in class (augmented with class
discussion and more detailed examples).
We haven't attempted to cover every topic in these lectures;
rather, we have attempted to give a deeper view of fewer topics.
Revising these slides 
is an ongoing activity; we would appreciate any <A
HREF="mailto:poole@cs.ubc.ca">feedback</A> you would like to give.
