The current plan for testing.

Each test will generate output that's dumped to a temp file, and diff'd against
the expected output for that test at that debug level.  Ideally `make -s` will
be completely silent, if all tests pass.  Similarly it should be possible to run
all the tests under valgrind in the same manner, albeit more slowly.

Source code will go in a toplevel src directory, with subdirectories for lib and
each binary.  Then mirror this with toplevel test-src, test-data and t-tmp
directories.
