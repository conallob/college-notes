\section*{Dataflow Machines}

Dataflow attempts to solve the \emph{"von Neumann"} bottleneck problem
by linking data to instructions and issuing the instructions fir
executuon as such as all the necessary data binding is complete.

Eg: $f \leftarrow 3 x^{2} + 6 x + 7$. $\therefore x \leftarrow 6$.

\end{table}

$\underleftarrow{x}, \underleftarrow{y} \left\{ 0 - 1000 \right\}$

$t$ - Scalar.

\begin{eqnarray*}
t						&	\leftarrow	&	3 \times 3				\\
\underleftarrow{y}	&	\leftarrow	&	\underleftarrow{X} + t	\\
\end{eqnarray*}

The pseudo random character of program assignments makes the efficient
design of the arbitration, distribution networks a formidable task.
Either, dataflow architecture has no inherent ability ot avail of the
efficiencies possible in executing vector assignments, such as
$\underleftarrow{n} \leftarrow + 3.7$ which is frequent, and execute very
efficiently on a vector processor.

So far, a number of experimental dataflow machines have been
constructed, but none have been marketed.

\section*{Systolic Arrays}

There are $2$ or $3$ dimensional pipelines, suitable only for
applications with very reegular data movement. For example - matrix
multiplication.
