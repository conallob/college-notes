\section{What is a Mainframe?}

\cite[Mainframes (often colloquially referred to as big iron) are large and 
"expensive" computers used mainly by government institutions and 
large companies for mission critical applications, typically bulk data 
processing such as censuses, industry/consumer statistics, ERP, and 
financial transaction processing]{m1}


Nowadays IBM, Unisys, Fujitsu and Bull all remain selling mainframes,
with \cite[IBM mainframes dominating the market at over 90\%]{m1}.
Between the 1950s and 1970s, mainframes were also manufactured by 
Sperry and Burroughs (now owned by Unisys), Siemens and Amdahl (now 
owned by Fujitsu), Hitachi, Control Data Corporation, General Electric, 
Honeywell, NCR, RCA, UNIVAC, Telefunken and ICL. \cite [ IBM's 
dominance grew out of their development of the 360 series mainframes; 
this basic architecture has continued to evolve into their current 
zSeries/z9 mainframe, which is arguably the only mainframe architecture 
still extant that dates from this early period.]{m1}

\section{Features and Uses of the Mainframe}

\section{Alternatives to the Mainframe}

Super computers, such as grids and lattices have proven to be a
compeditor to the mainframe. The fundemental difference a super computer
exhibits is that it consists of many inexpensive computers connected
together via a network. Depending on the design, some super computers 
are able to be repaired while in operation, just like a mainframe. 
Alternatively, corporations such as Google and Amazon simply add and 
subtract nodes and groups of nodes to their clusters in order to 
carry out repairs, to make upgrades or replacements without adversely 
affecting the system as a whole.


Many vendors and manufacturers use the term Total Cost Ownership (TCO)
to try and compare their products against mainframe alternatives. Due to
the much higher hardware costs of a mainframe, they try to argue that
their products are cheaper to run due to lower hardware costs. However,
true TCO comparisons between IT infrastructure also involve software
and administrative personell costs. Many TCO comparisons are
commissioned and paid for by software or hardware manufacturers, thus
scewing the results in their favour. The general consensus is that the
higher cost of a mainframe can sometimes be offset against lower
software and personell costs, depending on how the mainframe is being
used.

\section{The Fall and Resurrection of the Mainframe}

Traditionally, Mainframes were accessed using monochrome, text 
based "Dumb Terminals" such as the DEC VT100 over DB9 serial 
connections. In the 1980s and 1990s, dumb terminals were being replaced
by personal computers (PCs) on office desks when networking PCs together
became popular. As a result, mainframes were often referred to as
"dinosaurs" and their days were believed to be numbered. These
speculations were incorrect.


In the late 1990s, with the popularity of web services gowing, 
companies found new uses for their mainframes. By using server
virtualisation, they could offer web server performance similar 
to that of hundreds of smaller machines. The advantages of this
approach included lower power consumption and lower administrative 
costs. \cite[The growth of e-business has also dramatically increased the 
number of backend transactions processed by tried-and-true mainframe 
software as well as the size and throughput of databases. In late 2004,
IBM's mainframe revenues were increasing even with price reductions, 
thanks to attractive TCOs.]{m1}
